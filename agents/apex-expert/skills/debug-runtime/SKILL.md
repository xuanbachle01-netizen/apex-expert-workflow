name: Debug APEX runtime errors
description: Use when an APEX page shows an error, renders wrong, a process or validation misbehaves, a page is slow, or Page_Check reports a FAIL - and when the user asks why something in a running app does not work. Finds the cause from APEX debug messages, the activity log, the page definition and the database. Not for compile errors of .apx files (Check_App lists those).
---
## Overview
Locate the cause of a runtime problem in an APEX application with evidence (debug log, activity log, page definition, object status) and name the exact fix.

## Inputs
- Application id and page number; the error text or symptom (from the user or Page_Check).
- Tools: SQL_Query, Page_Check, Export_App + FS_Read, inspect-apps for dictionary queries.

## Steps
1. Reproduce WITH debug: Page_Check(app_id, pages, debug "yes"). For an error that needs a click, a submit or a dialog, reproduce it with UI_Test(debug "yes"): the failing step shows the message, JavaScript and server errors. The debug trace at the end lists per page_view_id the errors and warnings, each with the two messages before it, which usually name the process, validation, region or AJAX call that failed.
2. Full log of the failing request: `select message_level, elapsed_time, message from apex_debug_messages where page_view_id = <id from the trace> order by id` (narrow with `and message_level <= 4`, or `and id between ...` around the error). For a slow page, sort the same page view by `execution_time desc` to find the slow step.
3. Activity log (also for errors the user saw without debug): `select view_date, apex_user, page_id, elapsed_time, error_message, error_on_component_type, error_on_component_name from apex_workspace_activity_log where application_id = :id and error_message is not null order by view_date desc fetch first 20 rows only`.
4. Database side: INVALID objects (`select object_type, object_name from user_objects where status = 'INVALID'`) and `user_errors` for them; for a query error, run the region's SQL (from apex_application_page_regions.region_source) through SQL_Query with sample bind values.
5. Map the symptom to its owning component (region source, item source, process, validation, DA, authorization) with the dictionary views; read that component in the exported source when needed.
6. Report: cause (with the evidence line), the component to fix, the fix. Make the fix only if the user asked for it (apexlang-edit or sql-plsql skill).

## Rules
- Evidence first: quote the log line, the ORA- code or the query result. No speculative causes.
- Do not change database or app while diagnosing; diagnosing is read-only.
- An ORA-/PLS- error on a page usually comes from SQL or PL/SQL in the app or an INVALID package; an "Error processing request" without ORA usually from a validation or process condition.

## Example
Page_Check: page 3 FAIL "ORA-00904: STATUS: invalid identifier". Region "Task" source selects STATUS; user_tab_columns of TASKS has no STATUS -> the supporting-objects script never added it. Fix: guarded ALTER (sql-plsql) and reinstall.

## Gotchas
- apex_debug_messages only has rows for page views with debug enabled. The user's own page views usually have none: reproduce with debug "yes" instead of searching for old rows.
- Page_Check opens modal pages outside their dialog; APEX then logs "Dialog page N cannot be rendered", which the trace leaves out. Reproduce errors on modal pages with UI_Test.
- A UI_Test failure about what is shown (wrong layout, a missing highlight) leaves no debug error: take a {"shot"} and ask View_Screenshot.
- Errors inside a modal dialog appear on the dialog page, not the parent.
- Reference files (load_skill with this skill and filePath), Oracle's debugging guidance:
  - `references/failure-map.md` -- symptom to cause map (load first).
  - `references/owning-surfaces.md` -- which component owns which behaviour.
  - `references/fix-patterns.md` -- standard fixes.
  - `references/apex-debug-messages.md` -- reading debug output.
  - `references/checks-and-commands.md`, `references/example-scenarios.md`, `references/runtime-ui-verification.md` -- more checks and worked cases. Ignore their Oracle CLI commands; use your tools.
